Elk
==========

Elk ü¶å is a minimalist, [YAML][yaml] based task runner that aims to help developers to focus on building cool stuff,
instead of remembering to perform tedious tasks.

Since it's written in [Go][go], most of the commands runs across multiple operating systems (`Linux`, `macOS`, 
`Windows`) and use the same syntax between them thanks to this [library][sh].

*Why should i use this?* You can watch some [Use Cases]

## Getting Started
The main use case for `elk` is that you are able to run any command/s in a declarative way in any path. 

By default the global file that is going to be used is `~/ox.yml`. You can change this path if you wish to use another 
file by setting the `env` variable `ELK_FILE`.

`elk` will first search if there is a `ox.yml` file in the current directory and use that first, if the file is not 
found it will use the `global` file. 

This enables the user to have multiples `ox.yml` one per project while also having one for the system itself.

### Installation
1. Grab the latest binary of your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/jjzcru/elk/releases) page.
2. If you are running on `macOS` or `Linux`, run `chmod +x elk` to give `executable` permissions to the binary. If you
are on `windows` you can ignore this step.
3. Add the binary to `$PATH`.
4. Run `elk version` to make sure that the binary is installed.

## Syntax
The syntax consists on two main section one is `global` which sets defaults for all the tasks and the other is `tasks` 
which defines the behavior for each of the task.

To learn about the properties go to [Syntax Documentation][syntax].

### Example

```yml
version: ‚Äò1‚Äô
env_file: /tmp/test.env
env:
  FOO: BAR
tasks:
  hello:
    description: ‚ÄúPrint Hello World‚Äù
    env:
      FOO: Hello
      BAR: World
    cmds:
      - echo $FOO $BAR
```

## Use Cases
The goal of `elk` is to run `tasks` in a declarative way, anything that you could run on your terminal, you can run 
behind `elk`. If you handle multiple projects, languages, task or you want to automate your workflow you can use `elk`
to achieve that, just declare you workflow and `elk` will take care of the rest.
